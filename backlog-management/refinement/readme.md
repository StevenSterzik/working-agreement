# Backlog Refinement

## Goals

- Refine presented stories
- Estimate the **effort** required for the presented stories in the backlog.
- Identify any impediments to stories which are being refined
- Stories that are too large are sliced into smaller stories

## Participation

**Everyone** in the team should participate in the backlog refinement, including the Product Owner.

- [Product Owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/):

  - Facilitate the conversation.
  - Presents stories for refinement and estimation
  - Provide insight to stories where applicable
  - Refine story description or acceptance criteria

- Process Lead

  - Facilitate voting of stories
  - Take unanswered questions or comments to the 'parking lot'

- All team members:

  - Provide insight to stories where applicable
  - Ask question and raise concerns regarding presented stories
  - [Estimate](estimation/readme.md) the effort for each backlog item, as a team.

## Impact

- Stories with unclear/unrealistic descriptions/acceptance criteria can be identified
- Estimated stories enables sprint planning for that story
- Ensures stories are understood before being committed to a sprint

## Measures

- How many presented stories were able to be estimated?
- How many of the expected stories were refined?
- How were the estimations reflected against time taken to complete the story?
- How often is there a conflict in estimated points for a story?

## Facilitation Guidance

- Only stories that meet the [definition of ready](../../team-agreements/definition-of-ready/readme.md) should be estimated
- When estimating effort, the 'T-Shirt Sizes' approach will be used to estimate complexity of the story
- If an agreement can not be made on the effort, the largest effort amount wins the estimation
